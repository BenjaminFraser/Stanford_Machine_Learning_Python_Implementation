# Stanford Machine_Learning Python Implementation

Solutions and walkthroughs to the subjects taught in the popular Stanford Machine Learning course, taught by Andrew Ng. All solutions are implemented in Python from scratch, with minimal use of external libraries.

Some of the solutions still have problems and are not perfect, such as the from-scratch gaussian kernel implementation for support vector machines, and the poor performance of the from-scratch K-Means Clustering algorithm for very high-dimensional data (such as images), however these problems are minor and easily bypassed through using Sklearn models instead. The solutions to programming exercise 2 (logistic regression) are also problematic, and are not working correctly at this time, which will be rectified at a later date.

The training datasets for each of the programming exercises have been provided in the repo for convenience.
